## Tools:

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) for quick CSS.

## Implemented features:

1. Disable the blue Tweet button until a user has entered at least one character in the textarea.
2. As a user types, show the number of characters remaining (out of 140) in the tweet. If a user has entered more than 140 characters, disable the blue Tweet button.
3. When composing a Tweet, the color of the “characters remaining” indicator should change to dark red when only twenty characters remain, and light red when ten or fewer remain.
4. Allow users to attach a single photo to their tweet via a file picker dialog. When the photo has been uploaded, show it beneath the textarea, and allow users to delete the attachment by clicking the image. TBD
